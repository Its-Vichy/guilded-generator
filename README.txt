Hi everyone,
I come back with this update !

Keep in mind that you need to use proxies/vpn while guilded is open because they will ban your ip.
Also change the mail/pass on https://mail.tm (main.go)

You can remove the "//" before the join function to make your accounts join a guild, but guilded will ban your account for spam..

All generated account got e-mail verified, realistic PFP, Username, Bio, Online / dnd / Idle status.
Accounts are saved in email:pass:cookie:id format in data/tokens.txt.
